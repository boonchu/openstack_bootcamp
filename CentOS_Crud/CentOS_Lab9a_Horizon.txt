\f0\fs24 \cf0 Lab 9a: Log in to the Dashboard\
The dashboard is available on the node with the\'a0nova-dashboard\'a0server role.\
1. Ask the cloud operator for the host name or public IP address from which you can access the dashboard, and for your user name and password.\
2. Open a web browser that has JavaScript and cookies enabled.\
To use the Virtual Network Computing (VNC) client for the dashboard, your browser must support HTML5 Canvas and HTML5 Web Sockets. The VNC client is based on noVNC. For details, see\'a0noVNC: HTML5 VNC Client. For a list of supported browsers, see\'a0Browser support.\
3. In the address bar, enter the host name or IP address for the dashboard.\
	http://ipAddressOrHostName/horizon\
\
If a certificate warning appears when you try to access the URL for the first time, a self-signed certificate is in use, which is not considered trustworthy by default. Verify the certificate or add an exception in the browser to bypass the warning.\
4. On the\'a0Log In\'a0page, enter your user name and password, and click\'a0Sign In.\
The top of the window displays your user name. You can also access\'a0Settings\'a0or sign out of the dashboard.\
The visible tabs and functions in the dashboard depend on the access permissions, or\'a0roles, of the user you are logged in as.\

\'95 If you are logged in as an administrator, the\'a0Project\'a0tab and\'a0Admin\'a0tab are displayed.\
